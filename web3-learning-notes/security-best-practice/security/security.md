# Smart Contract Security

Security is a critical aspect of Web3 development. Exploits can lead to irreversible loss of user funds, protocol downtime, or complete failure.

## 🛡 Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability         | Description                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Reentrancy             | External calls re-enter the contract before update     |
| Integer Overflow       | Arithmetic errors from unchecked math (pre-0.8.x)      |
| Front-running          | Miners can manipulate transaction ordering             |
| Phishing & Spoofing    | Fake contracts, tokens, or approval requests           |
| DoS Attacks            | Denial-of-service via gas limit or state blocking      |
| tx.origin Attacks      | Misuse of `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`          |

## 🔒 Key Security Practices

- Use **Solidity ≥0.8.0** (has built-in overflow protection)
- Apply the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern
- Limit contract logic surface area
- Separate user funds from business logic
- Minimize external calls (if needed, use try/catch)

---

## ✅ Use Security Libraries

- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
- [ReentrancyGuard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/security#ReentrancyGuard)
- [SafeMath](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/utils#SafeMath) (for older Solidity)

## 🔧 Security Checklist Before Deployment

- [ ] Review all `require()` and `assert()` checks
- [ ] Confirm correct use of `onlyOwner`, `nonReentrant`, etc.
- [ ] Add unit and fuzz tests for edge cases
- [ ] Use static analysis tools (Slither, MythX)
- [ ] Audit the code or get a peer review

## 🧪 Security Tools

| Tool        | Purpose                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Slither     | Static analysis of Solidity    |
| MythX       | Symbolic execution and fuzzing |
| Tenderly    | Realtime debugging + monitoring|
| Remix IDE   | Manual static analysis         |
