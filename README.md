## [✍️ web3-planning](./)

This section outlines my personal journey and future plans in Web3 development.

Over the past few months, I’ve been actively following Web3 news, tracking airdrops, and diving deeper into decentralized app development using Flutter and Solidity.

### ✅ What I’ve Achieved So Far:

Built two Web3 mobile apps using Flutter:

* 🖼️ [NFT Minter]('https://github.com/alkhatib99/nft_minter_app') – Allows users to mint NFTs directly from their mobile devices.

* 📊 Crypto Tracker – Provides real-time cryptocurrency price updates and alerts

* 🔑 [Flutter Web3 Wallet]('https://github.com/alkhatib99/flutter-web3-wallet') – A sleek, testnet-ready Web3 wallet UI built in Flutter using web3dart.

* 👨‍💻 I Learned Solidity and wrote my first smart contract.

* ✍️ Currently, Working on [Gas Price Tracker]('https://github.com/alkhatib99/gas_price_tracker')

### 🚀 Upcoming Projects & Ideas:
I plan to expand my Web3 portfolio with the following DApps and tools:

* 🎮 On-Chain Game Logic – Game mechanics executed fully on the blockchain.

* 🧾 Multisig Wallet Simulator – Simulate multisignature wallet approvals in-app.

* 🗳️ Voting DApp – Token-based decentralized voting system.

* 🖼️ NFT Minting DApp – More advanced version with metadata customization.

* 🔐 Ethereum Wallet Generator – Securely generate wallets from Flutter.

* 📈 Gas Price Tracker – Ongoing project for real-time gas insights.

My goal is not only to sharpen my skills but also to attract clients by offering smart, real-world Web3 solutions built with modern tools.
