# Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

Layer 2 (L2) refers to blockchain scaling frameworks built on top of Layer 1 (e.g., Ethereum) to improve transaction speed, reduce gas fees, and increase throughput without sacrificing decentralization or security.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Layer 2?

- Ethereum mainnet (L1) has limited TPS (~15/sec)
- High congestion ‚Üí high gas fees
- L2 offloads computation & batching of transactions

## üß† Layer 2 Categories

### 1. **Rollups**
Bundle multiple txs into one, then post proof to Ethereum.

| Type           | Description                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Optimistic     | Assume valid, challenge period (e.g., Arbitrum) |
| ZK Rollups     | Use validity proofs (e.g., zkSync, Starknet)    |

### 2. **Sidechains**
Independent chains with their own consensus (e.g., Polygon PoS)

### 3. **State Channels**
Off-chain txs between parties, settled on-chain later (e.g., Raiden)

### 4. **Validium**
Similar to ZK rollups but with off-chain data availability

## üîÑ Bridging to L2

Use bridges to move assets from L1 ‚Üí L2:

```plaintext
1. Connect wallet
2. Approve token for bridge
3. Initiate deposit
4. Wait for confirmation/finality
```

Popular bridges:
- [Hop Protocol](https://hop.exchange/)
- [Orbiter Finance](https://www.orbiter.finance/)
- [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge)

---

## üõ° L2 Security Model

- Inherits security from L1
- Rollup contracts live on Ethereum
- Fraud proofs or validity proofs enforce trust
