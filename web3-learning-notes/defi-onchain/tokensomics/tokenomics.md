# Tokenomics in Web3

**Tokenomics** refers to the economic design of a crypto token — including its supply, distribution, utility, incentives, and governance role in a blockchain ecosystem.

## 🧠 Why Tokenomics Matters

- Drives user behavior (buy, stake, vote, burn)
- Influences price dynamics and sustainability
- Attracts investors and users
- Helps align protocol and community interests

## 🧱 Key Tokenomics Components

| Component        | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Supply           | Total, circulating, max, inflation/deflation mechanisms       |
| Utility          | What users can do with the token (governance, fees, staking)  |
| Distribution     | How tokens are initially and continuously allocated           |
| Incentives       | Yield, staking rewards, play-to-earn, liquidity mining        |
| Governance       | Voting rights, proposal submissions, on-chain/off-chain       |

## 🔄 Supply Models

### 1. Fixed Supply
- Total token amount capped forever (e.g., BTC, LINK)

### 2. Inflationary
- New tokens continuously minted (e.g., ETH post-merge, DOGE)

### 3. Deflationary
- Tokens burned via fees or buybacks (e.g., BNB, SHIB)

## 🎯 Common Allocation Models

```plaintext
- Team & Founders: 10–20%
- Investors (VCs): 10–25%
- Community/Airdrops: 10–15%
- Ecosystem/Grants: 20–40%
- Liquidity & Staking Rewards: 10–30%
```

> Vesting schedules and lock-ups prevent dumping.

## 🛠 Token Utility Examples

| Token Type | Utility Example                    |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Governance | Vote on DAO proposals (e.g., UNI)   |
| Fee Token  | Pay gas or usage fees (e.g., ETH, BNB) |
| Access     | Gate access to features/content     |
| Staking    | Lock tokens for yield or security   |
| Medium of Exchange | Payments in dApps or games   |

## 📊 Evaluating Tokenomics

- Is the token actually needed?
- Who gets tokens early (VCs, team)?
- What’s the vesting period?
- Is there real demand for token utility?
