## 👨‍💻 About Me

[Abedalqader Alkhatib](./README.md) — a top-ranked Computer Science graduate, Flutter developer, and Web3 enthusiast with a passion for building smart, scalable, and innovative software solutions.

I graduated with honors, ranked first in my class, and quickly turned my academic excellence into real-world impact. My journey started with tutoring students and supporting graduation projects, then evolved into working with a variety of clients as a freelancer. Over the years, I’ve built full-stack mobile applications, automated systems with Python, and explored the cutting edge of blockchain and AI technologies.

I'm particularly interested in integrating Web3 into modern apps using Flutter, experimenting with Solidity, and bringing decentralized solutions to life through intuitive user interfaces.
