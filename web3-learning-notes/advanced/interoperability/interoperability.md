# Blockchain Interoperability

**Interoperability** refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate, transfer data, and share assets seamlessly across networks.

---

## 🌉 Why Interoperability Matters

- Connects isolated ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos)
- Enables cross-chain dApps, DeFi, and NFTs
- Reduces user friction and increases capital efficiency
- Powers the vision of a multi-chain Web3

---

## 🔄 Interoperability Models

### 1. **Trusted Bridges**
- Run by a central operator
- Fast but less decentralized
- Examples: Binance Bridge, Avalanche Bridge

### 2. **Decentralized Bridges**
- Run by smart contracts and validators
- Higher security and censorship resistance
- Examples: Wormhole, Hop, LayerZero

### 3. **Light Clients**
- Use block headers and proofs for verification
- Secure but expensive and complex
- Used in Cosmos IBC

### 4. **Relays / Messaging Protocols**
- Send arbitrary messages across chains
- Examples: Axelar, LayerZero, CCIP (Chainlink)

## 🚀 Major Interoperability Projects

| Project      | Method           | Networks Supported               |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Wormhole     | Validator network| Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche, etc |
| LayerZero    | Ultra Light Node | EVM + non-EVM chains             |
| Axelar       | Cross-chain routing | Cosmos + EVM chains           |
| Chainlink CCIP | Oracle + messaging | Universal standard in progress |

---

## 🛡 Security Concerns

- Bridge hacks are a major source of Web3 loss (~$2B+)
- Use reputable bridges and verify contracts
- Multi-sig and oracle manipulation are common targets

---

## 🔧 Developer Use Cases

- Cross-chain token transfers
- Unified liquidity pools
- NFT bridging and minting across chains
- Governance sync between L1 and L2
