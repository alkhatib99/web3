# Web3Dart  

Welcome to my Web3Dart learning repository! This repo contains my experiments, notes, and practice projects using the [Web3Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart) package—a powerful Dart library that allows you to interact with Ethereum blockchains directly from your Flutter or Dart applications.

## 📚 What is Web3Dart?

**Web3Dart** is a Dart library that provides a simple API for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains. It supports:

- Connecting to Ethereum nodes (via JSON-RPC or WebSocket)
- Reading blockchain data (e.g., account balances, transactions)
- Signing and sending transactions
- Interacting with smart contracts using ABI definitions

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

- Understand how to use Web3Dart in real Flutter/Dart projects
- Learn how to:
  - Connect to Ethereum testnets (like Ropsten, Goerli, or Sepolia)
  - Generate Ethereum wallets (private/public keys, addresses)
  - Read and write to smart contracts
  - Handle gas fees and transaction signing
- Build basic decentralized app (dApp) UIs using Flutter

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Flutter & Dart
- [Web3Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart)
- Infura / Alchemy / Local Ethereum node
- MetaMask (for wallet interactions)
- Solidity (for contract development and testing)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To try out the code in this repo:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web3dart_learning.git
   cd web3dart_learning
   ```

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Run the example apps:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
Make sure to set up your .env or config.dart file with your RPC provider (e.g., Infura or Alchemy URL) and any necessary private keys (NEVER commit private keys).

⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is for learning purposes only. Do not use real funds or mainnet private keys in these projects.
