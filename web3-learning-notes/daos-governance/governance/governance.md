# Governance in Web3

Governance is the process through which Web3 communities make decisions. It determines how upgrades are proposed, voted on, and executed in decentralized protocols and DAOs.

---

## 🧠 Why Governance Matters

- Keeps protocols community-driven
- Distributes power among stakeholders
- Enables upgrades, fund allocation, and decision-making
- Prevents centralization of control

---

## 🛠 Governance Models

### 1. **Token-Based Voting**
- 1 token = 1 vote
- Most common in DeFi (e.g., UNI, COMP)

### 2. **Quadratic Voting**
- Limits influence of whales
- Vote cost = square of the number of votes

### 3. **Delegated Voting**
- Token holders delegate voting power to representatives

### 4. **Multisig Governance**
- Limited set of trusted signers
- Used in early-stage or smaller DAOs

## 📜 Governance Process (Typical Flow)

1. **Proposal Drafting** – Shared on forum or Discord
2. **Discussion** – Community provides feedback
3. **Voting** – On Snapshot or on-chain system
4. **Execution** – If passed, actions are executed automatically or by multisig
