# Roadmap - Solana Sniping Bot

This project will be developed in two passes: Token and NFT snyping.
We'll focus first on the Token sniper (Module 1).

Timeline is aggressive. Start with the basic MON tasks.

## Part 1: Token Sniper

- [ ] Structure folders and conventions (201)
- [ ] Write monitor.py - track listings on Raydium (new token/added_pairs)
- [ ] Write executor.py - send buy/tx requests with compute priority
- [ ] Add config/settings.json - rpc urls, wallet, slippage, retry settings
- [ ] Implement logging/reports and debugging

## Part 2: NFT Sniper

- [ ] Scaffold placeholders
- [ ] Track newm mints or listings on Magic Eden
- [ ] Lunch execution based on rarity/auto-snipers or metadata
- [ ] Filter logic based on config rules

## Status:
\n[IN PROGRESS] Project structure scaffolded.\n[DONE] REMDEEM and requirements.\n[DONE] ROADMAP committed.
