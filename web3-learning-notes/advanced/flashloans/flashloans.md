# Flash Loans in DeFi

**Flash loans** are uncollateralized loans where users borrow assets and return them in the same transaction block — or the entire operation fails.

---

## ⚙️ How Flash Loans Work

1. Borrow assets instantly from a protocol
2. Use them within the same transaction (e.g., arbitrage, liquidation)
3. Repay the full amount + fee
4. If not repaid, transaction reverts entirely

---

## 🧠 Why Flash Loans Are Powerful

- No upfront capital required
- Enable advanced strategies like arbitrage and liquidations
- Efficient and composable in DeFi ecosystems

## 🧱 Common Use Cases

| Use Case         | Description                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Arbitrage        | Buy low on one DEX, sell high on another             |
| Collateral Swap  | Replace collateral without liquidation                |
| Liquidations     | Repay bad debt and claim liquidated collateral       |
| Governance Attack| Temporarily acquire tokens to influence a vote       |

## 🔥 Flash Loan Protocols

- **Aave** – Pioneer of flash loans
- **DyDx** – Offers zero-fee flash trading
- **Uniswap** – Flash swaps via liquidity reserves
- **Balancer** – Multi-token flash loan support

## ⚠️ Security Risks

- Flash loan attacks (manipulate oracles, prices, governance)
- Often used in combination with reentrancy or low-liquidity targets
- Not inherently bad, but dangerous if not protected properly

---

## 🧪 Example: Flash Loan Logic (Aave v3)

```solidity
function executeOperation(
    address[] calldata assets,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    uint256[] calldata premiums,
    address initiator,
    bytes calldata params
) external override returns (bool) {
    // Use funds for arbitrage, liquidation, etc.

    // Repay loan + fees
    for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
        uint amountOwed = amounts[i] + premiums[i];
        IERC20(assets[i]).approve(address(POOL), amountOwed);
    }
    return true;
}
```

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

- Use time-weighted average prices (TWAP)
- Apply slippage limits and circuit breakers
- Avoid logic dependent on token balance mid-tx
- Limit governance power from flash-acquired tokens
