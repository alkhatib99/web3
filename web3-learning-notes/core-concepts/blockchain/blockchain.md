# Blockchain Fundamentals

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed, append-only ledger composed of cryptographically linked blocks. It allows secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant recording of data without a central authority.

## Key Concepts

- **Block**: A batch of transactions
- **Hash**: Unique fingerprint of a block
- **Consensus**: Mechanism to agree on the next block (e.g., PoW, PoS)
- **Smart Contract**: Code deployed on the blockchain that runs deterministically

## Why Blockchain?

- Trustless interactions
- Transparent and auditable
- Resistance to censorship
- Ownership without intermediaries

## Ethereum Overview

- **Accounts**: EOAs (wallets) & Contract accounts
- **Gas**: Fees required to perform operations
- **Transactions**: State-changing messages between accounts

## Testnets vs Mainnet

| Type    | Use Case                   | Example         |
| ------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Mainnet | Real ETH & production use  | Ethereum        |
| Testnet | Testing without real value | Sepolia, Goerli |

## Blockchain Use Cases

- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- NFTs and Gaming
- Identity verification (SSI)
- Supply chain traceability
- Decentralized file storage

## Best Practices

- Use testnets for testing smart contracts
- Monitor gas fees before deploying
- Verify contract source code on block explorers
- Use contract upgrade patterns carefully
