# DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)

**DAOs** are on-chain communities that coordinate and govern themselves using smart contracts, shared treasuries, and token-based voting ‚Äî without a centralized authority.

## üß™ DAO Use Cases

- Protocol governance (e.g., Uniswap, Aave)
- Grant allocation (e.g., Gitcoin, ENS DAO)
- Community funds and investments (e.g., MetaCartel)
- NFT project decisions and royalties (e.g., Nouns DAO)

## üì¶ Starting a DAO

1. Create a smart contract treasury (e.g., Safe)
2. Issue governance tokens (ERC-20)
3. Set up a voting mechanism (snapshot or on-chain)
4. Use platforms like DAOhaus, Tally, Aragon

## üõ† DAO Tooling Ecosystem

| Tool       | Use Case            |
|------------|---------------------|
| Snapshot   | Off-chain governance |
| Tally      | On-chain voting UI   |
| Safe (Gnosis) | Treasury & multisig |
| JokeDAO    | Fun proposal voting |
| Aragon     | DAO creation toolkit |

## üîê DAO Security

- Ensure proposal validation logic is secure
- Use multisigs for treasury control
- Regularly audit governance contracts
