# Auditing Smart Contracts

A smart contract audit is a thorough review of contract code to identify vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, or design flaws. It is essential before deploying on mainnet.

## 🧠 Why Audits Matter

- Ensure code is secure and behaves as intended
- Prevent loss of funds due to exploits
- Build user and investor confidence
- Help maintain project reputation and longevity

## 🛠 Audit Process

1. Freeze and tag the codebase for auditing
2. Choose an audit provider (internal or external)
3. Perform internal pre-audit checks
4. Undergo formal audit
5. Address all findings and re-audit if necessary
6. Publish full audit report
